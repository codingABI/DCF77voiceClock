/* Code which is not mine:
 * 
 * I use the foreign code 
 * - summertime_EU to detect summer-/wintertime
 * - getBandgap to read Vcc for the MCU
 * 
 * If you want to compile my sketch you have to:
 * - Get code for summertime_EU from https://forum.arduino.cc/t/rtc-mit-sommerzeit/168068/3#msg1278536 and append the code to this file.
 * - Get code for getBandgap from https://forum.arduino.cc/t/measuring-battery-voltage-conditionally/319327/5 and append the code to this file.
 * 
 * Thank you "jurs", "Coding Badly" and "Retrolefty" for your code!
